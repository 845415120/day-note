## 1. Level Doesn't Matter, Results Do  
1. 水平无关紧要，结果很重要

Nobody asks how long you've been developing if you are solving their problems. Don't put off learning about a topic you're interested in just because it's called advanced. You never know what you'll be asked to build, so it might just come in handy sooner than you think.  
如果你正在解决他们的问题，没有人会问你已经发展了多长时间。不要仅仅因为它被称为高级而推迟学习您感兴趣的主题。你永远不知道你会被要求构建什么，所以它可能比你想象的要快派上用场。

2.不要背诵

Learn how to find the information you need. I'm not talking about StackOverflow and GenAI. For the tools and languages you're using, know where the spec or documentation lives. Find out who writes the best guides.  
了解如何查找所需信息。我不是在谈论 StackOverflow 和 GenAI。对于您正在使用的工具和语言，请了解规范或文档所在的位置。找出谁写了最好的指南。

It doesn't matter if you can't remember if the `?` or `:` goes first when you go to use a JavaScript conditional operator. It matters that you know when to use a conditional operator and where to find the exact syntax.  
当你去使用 JavaScript 条件运算符时，如果你不记得 `?` or `:` 是否在前面，也没关系。重要的是要知道何时使用条件运算符以及在哪里可以找到确切的语法。

Tools constantly update. Always check the version of the docs you're reading. Find a way to keep up to date, whether it's a newsletter or that one friend who's really into CSS.  
工具不断更新。请务必检查您正在阅读的文档版本。找到一种方法来保持最新状态，无论是时事通讯还是真正喜欢 CSS 的朋友。

3. 深入了解基础知识

Take it from someone who's worked in three JavaScript frameworks in 3 years - if you know the basics well, it's a lot easier to learn a new tool in the ecosystem. You'll probably end up writing simpler, more robust software. You won't try to write features that already exist because you didn't know they existed. You'll better understand the errors you get and anticipate errors before you cause them.  
从在 3 年内使用过三个 JavaScript 框架的人那里获得它 - 如果你非常了解基础知识，那么在生态系统中学习新工具会容易得多。你最终可能会编写出更简单、更强大的软件。您不会尝试编写已经存在的功能，因为您不知道它们的存在。您将更好地了解您遇到的错误，并在导致错误之前预测错误。

4. 系统思维会让你走得更远

Troubleshooting any bug requires systems thinking. If you don't think about the plug in the wall, you won't think to check it when the toaster won't turn on. Being able to think about the system as a whole makes it easier to predict edge cases and design new features. Read more on how to create mental models for your codebase in [Getting Started in a New Codebase](https://dev.to/abbeyperini/getting-started-in-a-new-codebase-e7b#6-mental-models)  
对任何错误进行故障排除都需要系统思考。如果你不考虑墙上的插头，你就不会想到在烤面包机不开的时候检查它。能够将系统作为一个整体来考虑，可以更轻松地预测边缘情况和设计新功能。在新代码库入门中阅读有关如何为代码库创建心智模型的更多信息

5. 先试后问，确保它永远不会是一个愚蠢的问题

Developers are usually problem-solving oriented. If you can show you tried a few things and they didn't work, they're probably going to want to dig in themselves to find out why the obvious solutions didn't work.  
开发人员通常以解决问题为导向。如果你能证明你尝试了一些东西，但它们没有奏效，他们可能会想自己挖掘，找出为什么明显的解决方案不起作用。

6. 每一行代码都是一种责任

[![A programmer, paused mid-typing saying "The most efficient way to get rid of all the bugs was to get rid of all the software."](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fy87ejruuzoq6xl4woj9z.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fy87ejruuzoq6xl4woj9z.png)

Write code like someone else is going to have to fix it. (Even if that someone is just you in 6 months.) Install packages like you're going to have to update them frequently. Document the why so you don't accidentally break something later. Learn the opinions of an opinionated tool before you make it integral to your system and find out its opinions clash with features you need.  
编写代码，就像其他人必须修复它一样。（即使那个人在 6 个月内只是你。安装软件包，就像您必须经常更新它们一样。记录原因，这样你以后就不会不小心破坏了某些东西。在你把一个固执己见的工具变成你的系统的一部分之前，先了解它的意见，并找出它的意见与你需要的功能相冲突。

7. 练习阅读他人的代码

The way software development is often taught may lead you to believe that you will often get to create fresh, brand new apps. It's much much much more likely that you will be fixing and adding features to an existing codebase. You may even spend more time reading code than writing it. Practice reading code and refactoring code without introducing new bugs.  
软件开发的教学方式可能会让你相信，你经常会创建全新的应用程序。您更有可能修复现有代码库并将其添加到现有代码库中。您甚至可能花更多的时间阅读代码而不是编写代码。练习阅读代码和重构代码，而不会引入新的错误。

8.测试，测试，再测试

As [Chocho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enriquezamudiolopez) said in his DevNexus 2024 talk, "Code is theory. Software is practice." Always run your code and test it before asking for review. Practice writing tests as much as possible. You'll find anticipating how a user could break your code and thinking about more than the happy path will make you a better developer.  
正如 Chocho 在他的 DevNexus 2024 演讲中所说，“代码就是理论。软件就是实践。在请求评审之前，请务必运行代码并对其进行测试。尽可能多地练习写作测试。您会发现，预测用户如何破解您的代码，并考虑比快乐的道路更多的内容将使您成为更好的开发人员。

9. 练习将需求转化为软件

Ticket #387 门票 #387

- Add a button to the page that opens a modal and allows a user to edit this data.  
    向页面添加一个按钮，用于打开模式并允许用户编辑此数据。

It will be expected that you can turn a requirement like that into a list of steps or pseudocode. If the ticket is too vague, it'll be your job to get the answers you need.  
预计您可以将这样的需求转换为步骤列表或伪代码。如果票证太模糊，你的工作就是得到你需要的答案。

After ironing out those steps, you'll be expected to turn them into code and (hopefully) tests for that code. Then it will be your responsibility to get that code through your company's version control, (hopefully) review, (hopefully) QA, and deployment process.  
完成这些步骤后，您需要将它们转换为代码并（希望）对该代码进行测试。然后，您将负责通过公司的版本控制、（希望）审查、（希望）QA 和部署过程来获取该代码。

Open Source is a great place to practice this.  
开源是实践这一点的好地方。

10. 社区极其重要

You're not going to get the most nuanced, unbiased perspective in social media posts. You need a support network to call when you need that perspective.  
你不会在社交媒体帖子中获得最微妙、最公正的观点。当你需要这种观点时，你需要一个支持网络来打电话。

Mentorship is a part of this. Going to local meetups and conferences are a great way to build your network and expand your development world view. Joining networking groups will give you access to senior developers' perspective.  
导师制是其中的一部分。参加当地的聚会和会议是建立网络和扩展开发世界观的好方法。加入网络小组将使您能够了解高级开发人员的观点。

Don't try to do this job all on your own. There's a lot of information out there, and it's easy to get overwhelmed or get tunnel vision.  
不要试图独自完成这项工作。那里有很多信息，很容易不知所措或视野模糊。

[![A comic with 4 panels, each showing a progress bar of a program compiling. In the first three panels, the developer is sad saying "I hate programming." In the last panel, the program has compiled and the programmer celebrates, saying "I love programming!"](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faajn7sm0cv6usmaa2ci2.jpg)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faajn7sm0cv6usmaa2ci2.jpg)

I'm not saying love your job or become the elusive Passionate Programmer. However, constant learning is opening yourself up to repeated discomfort. If you don't know why you want to keep waking up and doing that to yourself, you're going to burn out. It can totally be a selfish reason, but you have to know your why.  
我并不是说热爱你的工作或成为难以捉摸的激情程序员。然而，不断的学习会让自己反复感到不适。如果你不知道为什么你要一直醒来，对自己这样做，你就会筋疲力尽。这完全可能是一个自私的理由，但你必须知道你的原因。

12. 每个人都在自己的旅程中

You're not competing with others' careers and content. Someone else's path to success may not work for you at all. Focus on your unique perspective and strengths. Find and share your voice. Someone out there wants to hear it.  
你不是在与他人的职业和内容竞争。别人的成功之路可能根本不适合你。专注于您独特的视角和优势。查找并分享您的声音。外面有人想听。

Looking at my (or anyone else's) profiles may lead you to believe that my road to mid-level developer was straight and smooth. It couldn't be more to the contrary. I've stumbled and cried, broken prod, burnt out, and gotten stuck in many a rabbit hole.  
看看我（或其他任何人）的个人资料，你可能会相信我通往中级开发人员的道路是笔直而平坦的。恰恰相反。我跌跌撞撞地哭泣，摔断了棒子，筋疲力尽，被困在许多兔子洞里。

For that reason, I have to earnestly thank my husband, family, friends, and tech community for helping me stay on my feet. I must also thank many coworkers for taking a chance on my potential. Without y'all, I wouldn't have made it this far. I'm so grateful that I have.  
出于这个原因，我必须真诚地感谢我的丈夫、家人、朋友和科技界帮助我站稳脚跟。我还必须感谢许多同事，他们抓住了我的潜力。没有你们，我不会走到这一步。我很感激我有。
